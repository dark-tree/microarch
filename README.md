# microarch

**microarch** is a minimalistic, 8-bit, extensible, RISC, Harvard, load-store computer architecture intended for small low-power (or power constrained) microcontrollers.

It offers 8-bit data address space and up to 16-bit instruction address space, allowing for up to 256 bytes of directly addressable data memory and up to 64kB of directly addressable program memory.

The microarch processor has 8 registers available to the programmer with a powerful, unique register addressing system.
